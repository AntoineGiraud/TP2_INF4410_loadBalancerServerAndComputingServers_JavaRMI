# TP2 INF4410: Services distribués et gestion des pannes

Project: coding a master serveur that gives work to other computing servers

The load balancer server can
* handle nasty computing server (1+/3+) by selecting the most common answer returned.
* handle intempestive computing server disconection
* chunk into pieces if a load is too big for a server (if the computing server is too busy and rejects the computing contract)

Project Work made during a class in Polytechnique Montréal : [Systèmes répartis et infonuagique](http://www.polymtl.ca/etudes/cours/details.php?sigle=INF4410)
